#Noise Harmonograph

A project for fxHash https://www.fxhash.xyz/u/andrusenn

The armograph is a generation machine that works with pendulums.
The duration of the movement depends on the input forces and random environmental conditions.
But in the digital world, it could be forever.
Here is an infinite harmonograph breathing in a state of noise.
